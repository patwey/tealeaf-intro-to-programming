The error message:
  SyntaxError: (irb):2: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting '}'
    from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-rc2/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'

... Tells you that:
- You are using the REPL irb
- There is a SyntaxError on line 2, where a ')' was placed where a '}' was expected
- Most likely there is an open '{' somewhere earlier in the code.
