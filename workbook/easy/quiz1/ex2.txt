Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:

1. what is != and where should you use it?
  != stands for 'not equal to,' and can be used to compare two objects
2. put ! before something, like !user_name
  Turns an object into the opposite of its boolean equivalent.
3. put ! after something, like words.uniq!
  Placing a ! after a method causes it to change its caller.
  words.uniq! changes the words array permanently.
4. put ? before something

5. put ? after something
  Placing a ? after something causes it to make a comparison.
  number.odd? tests if a number is odd, and returns a boolean.
6. put !! before something, like !!user_name
  Turns an object into its boolean equivalent.
